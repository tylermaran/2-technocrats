## Stock Simulation App:

The goal of this project is to build an educational Stock Trading Simulation designed for the classroom setting. The end product will allow an instructor to create a classroom of students, with an initial rule set (i.e. starting funds, transaction fees, etc.) and then monitor student performace. 

Each student will be greeted with a login page requesting a classroom ID to join. The student will start with and empty portfolio and a set starting amount (~$10,000) to invest. From there the student can search for stocks to invest in, and add them to their portfolio. 

The professor can track each students portfolio performance throughout the class time.
